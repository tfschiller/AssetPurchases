- Open DataPreparation.R. Make sure that this file is in the same folder as the 'Data' folder as the R script will dynamically set the working directory and will search for the CSV files in this folder.

- Run this code. This will import the CSV files and will manipulate them into a suitable time series format to conduct the analysis. It will then save an R Data File with the manipulated datasets into the working directory. See the script for further details.  

- Run the Analysis.R file. This conducts appropriate statistical tests and computes the IRFs for the analysis of the effect of the Federal Reserve's LSAP programmes on asset prices.   

- Run the Inequality.R file. 

- All the relevant analysis and graphics are included in the Asset Purchases Markdown.Rmd file.
