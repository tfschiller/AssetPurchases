## Introduction

In response to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), on October 8<sup>th</sup> 2008, the Federal Researve, along with five other central banks, collectively reduced interest rates. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered its federal funds rate target to 1.5 percent. Then, on December 16<sup>th</sup> 2008, the FOMC cut its target rate effectively to zero (a target rate between 0 and 0.25 percent). 

In addition, the Federal Reserve (along with other central banks) launched large-scale asset purchase (LSAP) programmes designed to provide additional monetary stimulus (Hesse, Hofmann and Weber 2018). 



This paper analyses the effects of the Federal Reserve's LSAP programmes. Specifically, the effects on asset prices and wealth inequality are analysed. This is done using an SVAR approach to compute the effects of LSAP on asset prices, among other variables. The effects will then be used to compute a measure of the effect on inequality, following the approach of Domanski, Scatigna and Zabai (2016).
