## Introduction

On October 8 2008, in response to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the Federal Reserve, along with five other central banks around the world, collectively cut interest rates. This followed earlier cuts by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), where it had lowered its federal funds rate target from 5.25 percent in June 2006 to 1.5 percent following the cut on October 8 2008. On December 16 2008, the FOMC cut its target rate effectively to zero (specifcally, a target rate between 0 and 0.25 percent). 

At the time, the FOMC stated that along with cutting its federal funds rate target, it would 'employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability' (\hyperlink{fomc2008b}{FOMC 2008b}). With its conventional monetary policy tool at the zero lower bound, the Federal Reserve (along with other central banks) launched a large-scale asset purchase (LSAP) programme on November 25 2008 with the intention of providing additional monetary stimulus to the economy (\hyperlink{hesse2018}{Hesse, Hofmann and Weber 2018}). 

As part of its QE1 programme, the Federal Reserve announced it would buy \$100 billion in government-sponsored enterprise debt and up to \$500 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities. Since QE1, the Federal Reserve has conducted two further LSAP programmes: QE2 (announced in March 2010) and QE3 (announced in September 2012). These programmes have contributed significantly to the growth in the Federal Reserve's balance sheet (see Figure 1).

When the Federal Reserve announced the QE1 programme, it did so with the intention of 'supporting housing markets and fostering improved conditions in financial markets' (\hyperlink{fomc2008a}{FOMC 2008a}). However, despite the fact the Bank of Japan had experimented with LSAPs before 2008 (see \hyperlink{iwata2012}{Iwata and Takenaka 2012} for an overview), the scale and enduring nature of post-2008 LSAP programmes, relative to pre-crisis policy, is what has made these monetary policy tools unconventional, with the precise nature of their effects the subject of much research.   

This paper analyses the effects of the Federal Reserve's LSAP programmes using data up to the beginning of 2019. Specifically, the effects on asset prices and wealth inequality are analysed. This is done using an SVAR model to compute the effects of the Federal Reserve's LSAP programmes on asset prices, along with other macroeconomic and financial variables. The effects will then be used to compute a measure of the effect on inequality, following the approach of (\hyperlink{domanski2016}{Domanski, Scatigna and Zabai (2016)}). 
 
 
 
## Literature Review

#### LSAP as a Monetary Policy Tool

LSAP programmes, along with other _balance sheet policies_, are one of the two ways in which central banks implement monetary policy (the other being _interest rate policy_). As mentioned, LSAPs have played a significant role in the Federal Reserve's attempts to influence asset prices and financial conditions and to stimulate economic conditions after the federal funds target was cut to near zero. 

Two transmission mechansims through which LSAPs affect asset prices are commonly identified in the literature^[It is worth pointing out that even for conventional monetary policy, the mechanisms through which policy influences the real economy is the subject of much debate. For example, there has been debate about whether interest rate policy operates through the 'cost of borrowing' channel or through 'asset price channels' (\hyperlink{mishkin2016}{Mishkin 2016}). Unsuprisingly then, there is no definite consensus about how unconventional monetary policy affects assets prices and in turn the real economy]: the 'portfolio rebalancing effect' and the 'signalling effect'. The portfolio balance effect relies on the assumption that assets are imperfect substitutes. This means that as the Federal Reserve buys up safer, longer-term assets (eg long-term Treasuries), the price of these assets has to rise (and yields fall) so that households are willing to move their portfolios into riskier, short term assets, increasing prices and depressing yields on these assets^[More specifically, \hyperlink{wallace1981}{Wallace Neutrality (1981)} does not hold.]. 

Therefore as well as depressing longer-term yields on the class of assets purchased by the central bank, the portfolio rebalance effect results in households and private agents moving out of now lower yielding agency debt, MBS and Treasuries into other shorter term, riskier assets such as equities and coporate bonds. This has the effect of reducing the yields and increasing the prices on these assets (\hyperlink{gagnon2011}{Gagnon, Raskin, Remache and Sack 2011}). Therefore, LSAP programmes have the effect of increasing prices and reducing yields across a broad range of assets^[The portfolio rebalancing effect also works to reduce interest rates through a reduction in risk premiums. Specifically when Federal Reserve purchases longer-term securities it removes the "term premium" - the risk associated with holding longer duration assets, which is an important component in risk premiums - from the market.  Reducing risk premiums in general improves market functioning. For wider discussions see \hyperlink{gagnon2011}{Gagnon et al. 2011} and \hyperlink{mishkin2016}{Mishkin (2016)}].

The signalling effect occurs when the Federal Reserve makes a credible commitment to continue its LSAP programmes into the future. For example, when the Federal Reserve announed QE3, it committed to purchasing \$40 billion worth of MBS and \$45 billion of longer-term Treasuries 'until the outlook for the labour market has improved substantially in a context of price stability' \hyperlink{fomc2013}{(FOMC 2013)}. Therefore the FOMC makes a state-contingent commitment to maintain LSAP progammes until its wider macroeconomic objectives have been achieved, namely achieving its inflation target, increased employment and growth.    

In general this type of commitment signals that monetary policy will be kept loose for a certain duration. This should further reduce long-term interest rates as agents know short term rates will be lower for longer. Also, a commitment to continue LSAPs indicates interest rates will be held low. Specifically, if the Federal Reserve commits to buying assets at a future date, then the price of these assets will rise now (otherwise arbitrage is possible: agents could buy these assets now and sell them to the Federal Reserve at a higher price at the future as a result of higher demand) (\hyperlink{gangnon2011}{Gagnon et al. 2011}). 

The intended consequences of LSAP programmes, as a result of the portfolio rebalacing effect and the signalling effect, are to depress yields and increase asset prices across different asset classes. This will help to increase consumption and investment in the economy. LSAP programmes, through the aforementioned portfolio rebalancing and signalling effects, lead to increases in the wealth of households and the value of firms. Households therefore increase their consumption and firms their investment, spurring economic growth and employment. This supports the Federal Reserve's aims of maximising employment and stabilising prices.  

\hyperlink{weale2016}{Weale and Wieladek (2016)} find, using an SVAR, that LSAP programmes implemented in the US and the UK have had positive effects on GDP and CPI. They find that a LSAP programme shock equivalent to 1% of GDP increases real GDP by 0.62% in the US and 0.25% in the UK. CPI increases by 0.58% in the US and 0.32% in the UK. They suggest that in the US the portfolio reblancing effect is stronger than the signalling effect. No one dominant mechanism is identified for for the UK. 

\hyperlink{hesse2018}{Hesse at al. (2018)}, using a Bayesian VAR, investigate the macroeconomic effects of LSAP programmes in the US and the UK. They find an effect of about 0.2% on real GDP and CPI in both countries after a shock equivalent to 1% of GDP. Bond yields fall by up to 0.1% in the US and 0.2% in the UK. Stock prices increase persistantly by up to 2% in the US and 4% in the UK. Interesetingly, they find that the impact of earlier LSAP programmes are larger, possibly because subsequent LSAP programmes come to be anticipated by agents.    

\hyperlink{rosa2012}{Rosa (2012)} uses an 'event study approach' and determines the monetary policy shock by analysing copies of the _Financial Times_ before and after FOMC meetings to see the extent to which LSAP programmes were anticipated hy agents. \hyperlink{rosa2012}{Rosa (2012)} finds that the effect on the considered asset prices (Treasuries of different maturities, 5-year and 10-year TIPs, S\&P's 500 cash index) is not statistically different from an unanticipated cut in the FOMC target rate. The effect on prices is not explicitly reported. 

\hyperlink{borio2016}{Borio and Zabai (2016)} survey evidence on the effects of unconventional monetary policy measures since 2008. While they conclude that 'there is little doubt that [unconventional monetary policy measures] have had a lasting impact on bond yields [and] various asset prices' (p. 1), it is harder to distengle the effects owing to specific measures individually (for example the impact of LSAPs from that of forward guidance).

#### LSAP and Wealth Inequality

As discussed, LSAP programmes attempt to influence yields and asset prices, in order boosting economic growth and achieve targets for price stability. Therefore, in order to assess the impact of LSAP programmes on inequality, there is a need to consider the distribution of affected assets as well as the impact on the yield and price of these assets. In addition the impact on employment and incomes should be considered (although out of scope for this paper). 

\hyperlink{bunn2018}{Bunn, Pugh and Yeates (2018)} investigate the effect of reductions in interest rates and LSAP programmes on inequality in the UK through the effect on labour incomes, returns on saving, asset prices. Overall, they find that the effect of monetary policy on inequality in the UK between 2008 and 2014 was small. \hyperlink{ampudia2018}{Ampudia et al. (2018)} find that LSAP programmes in the Euro area reduce inequality. This is mainly because they help to reduce unemployment amongst poorer households.  

\hyperlink{domanski2016}{Domanski et al. (2016)} explore the effect of changes in monetary policy in six advanced economies. They examine the effects on household portfolio balances as a result of changes in interest rates and increases in asset prices as a result of unconventional monetary using household surveys on portfolio composition. They assume that changes in portfolio composition are independent of macroeconomic and financial conditions. 

They find rising equity prices may have added to wealth inequality, only party offset by rising real estate prices. This is because the fifth quintile of the wealth distribution hold a greater of their portfolio as equities, while the second quintile hold a greater proportion of their portfolio in real estate. This suggests that unconventional monetary policy has had the largest effect on inequality as a result of its impact on equity prices.    

## Methodology

Much of the literature that looks at the effects of LSAP programmes follows an 'event study approach' (see \hyperlink{borio2016}{Borio and Zabai (2016)}). This analyses the effect of LSAP programmes using a short time frame immediately before and after their announcement. Using a short time frames helps to control for other factors that may influence the variables of interest, thus isolating the effect of monetary policy on asset prices.    

However, \hyperlink{hesse2018}{Hesse et al.'s (2018)} finding that the impact of later LSAP programmes may be reduced because they have been anticipated by agents reduces the rationale behind using an event study approach. Some of the effect of the LSAP programme is missed by only considering a short time frame around announcement. Therefore an approach which does not restrict the time frame is justified (see \hyperlink{balatti2016}{Balatti, Brooks, Clements and Kappou (2016)} for a wider discussion of the drawbacks of using an arbitary event window).
